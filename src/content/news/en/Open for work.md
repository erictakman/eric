# Your Next Developer ðŸ‘‹

After 3 fantastic years on Gotland, I am now a fully trained system developer. My goal when I started my education was to build up my knowledge in both frontend and backend development to work cross-functionally as a full-stack developer. Now, I am actively looking for my new employer, with the hope of being involved in multiple parts of the development process and learning as much as possible from experienced colleagues. I want to be constantly challenged, learn new things, and continue to develop in what I can do. During my education, I discovered that architecture, ranging from frameworks and tools in frontend to databases and services in backend, is what I am passionate about. My future goal is to accumulate enough expertise to one day take on the role of a system architect.

This autumn, I am available for work both on-site in Stockholm and in a hybrid capacity anywhere in the world. If you are looking for a creative and problem-solving-oriented developer, you have found the right person!

Curious about what I have done before? Check out this portfolio page that I recently launched! Here, I gather news, experiences, and fun projects I am working on. If you want to know more about me, you can also take a look at my LinkedIn profile or my Github profile.
