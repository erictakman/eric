# Mushroom Cultivation with Raspberry Pi üçÑ

MushroomPi is a project designed to serve as a tool for enthusiasts who want to cultivate mushrooms at home. The project is built in Svelte using SvelteKit and utilizes a Raspberry Pi to control a fan and measure temperature with a thermometer. The idea is that mushroom growers, with the help of a box and a Raspberry Pi, can control and analyze data about their mushrooms. In the backend, Python is used to control the Raspberry Pi, and CockroachDB is used to store data.

MushroomPi is currently a private repository, but I hope to open up the project for open source contributions soon.
