# NPM Package ðŸ“¦

My interest in graphic design led me to start sketching icons that can be used on various websites and apps. After a while, I decided to explore how to create an NPM package and publish these icons. I chose to use Svelte to create the icons and build the package.

If you're interested in using the icons, you can install the package with npm in your next Svelte project:

<div class="pt-2"></div>

<div style="background-color: #e2e7eb; color: #4e5d6c; width: fit-content; border-radius: .4em; padding: 4px 12px;">
	npm install svelte-smidefix
</div>

<div class="pt-2"></div>

## Check out the package on [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/package/svelte-smidefix) or explore the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/erictakman/svelte-smidefix).
