# Web-Based Data Mesh Manager

This is my flagship project that originated from my desire to learn more about GraphQL. Initially, the idea was to build a web service for small businesses and startups to manage invoices. However, once I set up the project's architecture, I realized that I had the foundation for a project I wanted to continue developing. Since I don't have a huge interest in finance, I decided to turn my focus towards something I'm passionate about, which is data.

What I am currently building is a web application for companies to manage their data as products according to the data mesh concept, an idea for database architecture presented by Zaidak in December 2020 on [martinfowler.com](https://martinfowler.com/articles/data-mesh-principles.html).

The project is built using Ktor for backend handling and GraphQL for APIs. The frontend is built with React in Next.js and Typescript. I have also used Docker to manage the database and to run the project locally with a MongoDB database.

Currently, the project repository is private on Github, but I hope to open up the project for open source contribution in the near future.
