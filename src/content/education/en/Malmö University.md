# Bachelor's Degree in Built Environment at Malmö University

My bachelor's degree in Built Environment with a focus on Architecture, Visualization, and Communication included courses in project management, digital media, visual communication, and strategic communication with a focus on the built environment.

During my studies, we worked on several aspects within the construction sector. This included preliminary studies to analyze and evaluate construction projects, visualization of architectural drawings to communicate design ideas and plans, as well as the development of communication plans to effectively reach various stakeholders and target audiences.

I developed competencies in both technical and creative areas, which gave me a broad understanding of how to use communication and visualization to successfully present and convey ideas within the built environment.
