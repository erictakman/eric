# Computer Science Program with a Focus on Software Engineering

During my education, we worked on various software projects within web, desktop, and mobile applications, all with integration into a backend database. The program also had a strong focus on the organizational and methodological aspects of the developer's role, as well as the importance of clean code and design patterns.

During my education, I completed both a six-month internship and larger software projects at PayEx, a subsidiary of Swedbank that offers payment solutions for retail and e-commerce. During the internship, we were tasked with quality assurance and testing of an older system in a small team, and in the other project, we explored the possibilities of building an API for a data lake. It became clear how important Scrum and other agile methods are for large teams and systems.
