# Projects ðŸš€

During my education in system science, I, along with two other students, worked on a project for PayEx. The project aimed to create a prototype for a new service that would make it easier for the company to assist customers in obtaining customized balance statements. In the project, we were tasked with exploring possible solutions for an API with integration into a data lake. We created a prototype using serverless functions in Azure and GraphQL, which could dynamically fetch the relevant data for the customer's balance statement based on selected parameters.
