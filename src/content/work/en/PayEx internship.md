# Internship

During the autumn of 2022, I, along with two other students, completed an internship at PayEx. Here, we were tasked with investigating and ensuring the quality of one of their legacy systems. It was a close collaboration with developers, product owners, and customer service. In the assignment, we had the freedom to outline the project's progress and plan for what we could potentially solve during the duration of our internship.
