# Communicator at AG Arkitekter AB

As a communicator at AG, I was responsible for administration, business development, and the graphic profile. Since I was the only communicator, the work was self-driven while also requiring close collaboration with architects and construction engineers.

During my time at AG, I worked on various aspects of communication and administration. Unfortunately, they had to lay off all new hires when the pandemic hit, and it gave me time to think about what I wanted to do. Although I appreciate working in communication, I realized that I prefer operational work and chose to train as a system developer.
