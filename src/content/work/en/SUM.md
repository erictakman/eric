# Editor-in-Chief at Malm√∂ University Student Magazine ‚úç

Together with a classmate, I took on the role of editor-in-chief at Malm√∂ University's magazine, SUM Magazine. The magazine had been around for a while and was previously named Mahskara. Since the 'h' in the name indicated "university college," and the school was transitioning to university status during our time as editors, we decided to update the magazine's name to SUM (Student Union Magazine). Being the editor-in-chief of the magazine involved everything from recruiting writers, illustrators, and photographers to setting up communication channels in Slack, designing the magazine, and conducting interviews. During our time, we released four magazines, one for each quarter, before passing it on to the next group of editors and students who wanted to contribute to the university's own magazine.
