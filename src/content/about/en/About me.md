# Hello ðŸ‘‹

I am a structured, analytical, and communicative system developer who enjoys being involved in the entire development process. My ambition is to work cross-functionally as a full-stack developer, and I thrive in teams where I can contribute my knowledge and experience. I have a background in communication and worked as a communicator at an architectural firm in Stockholm before I chose to change my path and train to become a system developer. People I have worked with have described me as a committed and curious colleague who is good at creative problem-solving and analysis. There are no problems I don't want to solve, and I am a person driven by constantly learning new things in what I do.

My background lies in graphic design, communication, and visualization, which has been of great benefit as a developer. I am a developer who enjoys bouncing ideas around and always does my utmost to deliver high-quality and innovative solutions.

I have put together this web portfolio so that those interested in getting to know me better can go through who I am and what I have done.

You can also call me Ruffe ðŸ˜‰
